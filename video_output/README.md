# Video Output Directory

This directory contains generated videos and production artifacts from the Video Production Agent.

## Structure

```
video_output/
├── *.mp4                       # Final rendered videos
├── audio/                      # Generated narration audio files
├── visuals/                    # Generated visual assets
└── logs/                       # Production logs and summaries
```

## Generated Files

Videos generated by the agent will appear here with names matching the source script files.

Example: `VIDEO_PRODUCTION_PACKAGE.md` → `VIDEO_PRODUCTION_PACKAGE.mp4`

## Production Logs

Check `logs/production_summary.txt` for a human-readable summary of the production run, or `logs/production_summary.json` for detailed structured data.

Individual script logs are saved as `logs/<script_name>_log.txt`.

## Usage

Run the video production agent:

```bash
./scripts/video-production-agent.sh
```

For more information, see `scripts/video_production/README.md`.
